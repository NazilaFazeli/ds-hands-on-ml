The model it fits can be controlled with the loss parameter; by default, it fits a linear support vector machine (SVM). We will use it here to further emphasise the importance of scaling and will set the loss parameter to `log_loss`. This way the model will be a logistic regression using stochastic gradient descent for learning."

That means it will evaluate all of the possible parameter combinations of the search space in order to find and return the best combination. \n",
